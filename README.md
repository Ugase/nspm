## nspm

nspm stands for 'not shit password manager'  
nspm is the reboot of spm (shitpasswordmanager)


### how it's better (or worse)
- uses hashing for storing the master password
- better password storing (not really)
- actually structured directories so you don't have to make copies of the program
- better interface
- You don't have to make passwords that are divisable by 32
- Removed redundent "Get password" option
- better with generated password

### how it's worse
- there's a problem that i don't know how to fix

#### todo:
- make gui
